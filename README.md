# WyvernDB

This is a website that serves as a database of all Wyvern CCG cards.

## Missing Information

Pack contents are not yet accurate, because:

- What is the probability of getting a gold/silver wyvern in Premiere? What card in the pack does it replace?
- There are 4 rare cards in Phoenix, but no rare slot in the booster packs. How is this so?
- The 60th card of Kingdom starter decks is labelled as "special". How so?
- Apparently, "you have more chances to get a common-3 than a common-1 card when opening a booster or starter pack". What is this probability?
